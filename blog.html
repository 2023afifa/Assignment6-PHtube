            <p class="text-xl"> <span class="font-bold">Ans:</span> var - The scope of the var keyword is the global scope. Variables declared outside the function can be accessed globally, and variables declared in a particular function can be accessed only that function. <br>
            let - The scope of a let variable is block scoped. It can't be accessed outside the particular block. We can reassign it.<br>
            const - const keyword is also block scoped. It is same as let but we can't reassign the const variable.</p>

            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Q: Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
            <p class="text-xl"><span class="font-bold">Ans:</span> Undefined means the variable is declared, but its value is not assigned. Undefined can't find the value in the code that's why it return 'undefined'. Null means an empty value or a blank value. We assign the value empty that's why it shows 'null'. typeof() Null is an object.</p>
